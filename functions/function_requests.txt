*** SHARED FUNCTIONS BACKLOG ***
All requests for new shared functions should be placed in this file. Please place requests under the 'NEW FUNCTION REQUESTS' heading, along with the date of the request, a description, and your name.

NOTE: Your function will be built from the description you provide, so please be precise.

Example:

Function Name: student_email_login
Request Date: May 25
Requester: John Doe
Description: This function will allow students to login using their email and password. This function should accept email and password as parameters, and return a value of true/false depending on if the login was successful.


*** NEW FUNCTION REQUESTS ***

(edit this as needed and please feel free to contact me for clarification)
Function Name: send_password ( $email )
Request Date: May 29
Requester: Jordan Carter
Description: This function retrieves the password in the database associated with an e-mail address, passed from an input field, and sends it through e-mail to that address. This is for the forgot password pages on the front end and admin sides. If this is demanding too much, then perhaps just a general mail function will do.
